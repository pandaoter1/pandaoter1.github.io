    <p class="aboutTekst"><br>
    I have always been obsessed with creating<br>
    things and solving problems, which has led me to creating<br> 
    projects through the years. In these projects I always <br>
    had a broad interest. I find both economy and building the<br>
    solution interesting.<br><br>
    Building solutions to demanded problems have always<br>
    been an interest of mine. Every time someone proposes a<br>
    problem, I always want to find the solution, because<br>
    nothing beats the feeling of solving a high demand problem.
